R codes related to and instructions to reproduce results in manuscript titled "Misdiagnosis-Related Harms in Vertigo-Stroke Dyad: Quantification Through Mixture Models and Harm Measures"

See README files in each folder for specific instructions related to simulation, data analyses, and the synthetic dataset. A synthetic dataset was generated because the Taiwan LHID2010 dataset is not publicly available. Data analyses performed on the synthetic dataset is not expected to generate the exact same results as shown in the paper, but function as an illustration of the procedures proposed and work done in this paper.
