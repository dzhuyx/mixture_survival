# Simulation studies
R codes used for simulation studies. All numbers (Table 2) and figures (Figure 1 and figures in Table 2) presented in the simulation studies can be reproduced using codes in this folder.

File `simulation_master.R` contains a descriptive flow of the entire simulation analysis. `for` loops in this file can be replaced with parallel jobs on a computing cluster to reduce computing time.
